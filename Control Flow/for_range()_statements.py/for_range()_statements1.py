# Iterate over a sequence of numbers

# Use a for-loop to iterate over a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9
for number in range(10):
    # Print the current number in the sequence
    print(number)  
    # The 'range(10)' function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9 (inclusive)
    # On each iteration, 'number' takes on the next value in this sequence
