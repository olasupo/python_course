def addition(a, b):
    """
    This function takes two numbers 'a' and 'b' as input and returns their sum.
    """
    result = a + b  # Calculate the sum of 'a' and 'b'
    return result  # Return the result of the addition

# Define a function 'subtraction' that takes two arguments 'a' and 'b'
def subtraction(a, b):
    """
    This function takes two numbers 'a' and 'b' as input and returns their difference.
    """
