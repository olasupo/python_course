# Iterate within a range of given numbers, step by 2

# Use a for-loop to iterate over a sequence of numbers starting from 4 up to, but not including, 10, with a step of 2
for number in range(4, 10, 2):
    # Print the current number in the sequence
    print(number)  
    # The 'range(4, 10, 2)' function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 4 up to 9 (inclusive), stepping by 2
    # On each iteration, 'number' takes on the next value in this sequence, incremented by 2
